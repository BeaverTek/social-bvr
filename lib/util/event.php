     * Named events include receiving an XMPP message, adding a new notice,
     * or showing part of an HTML page.
     *
     * The arguments to the handler vary by the event. Handlers can return
     * two possible values: false means that the event has been replaced by
     * the handler completely, and no default processing should be done.
     * Non-false means successful handling, and that the default processing
     * should succeed. (Note that this only makes sense for some events.)
     *
     * Handlers can also abort processing by throwing an exception; these will
     * be caught by the closest code and displayed as errors.
